### Hey, what's up👋 My name is Bogdan!

#### 👨‍💻About me:
I am a beginner Python backend developer. My journey in IT started in 7th grade when I first joined a programming club 
for Pascal. About a year later, I left the club. After that, there was a gap of a couple of months when I tried myself 
in various directions, namely, I attempted to learn C/C++. I also got interested in boards and microcontrollers 
(Arduino) for a while, and tried my hand at creating mobile applications using Kotlin. However, web development 
fascinated me the most! From June 2022 until today, I have been actively learning the Python programming language 🐍 
through Stepik courses.
